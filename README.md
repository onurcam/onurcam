# Hi, I'm Onur Cam 👋

## I'm an Entrepreneurial Engineer who builds and scales technology-driven businesses.

With 19 years of hands-on technical experience and a deep focus on the e-commerce ecosystem, I don't just write code—I build revenue-generating systems. In the last 8 years, I have founded, scaled, and successfully **exited 4 e-commerce companies**.

Most recently, I've been diving deep into **Artificial Intelligence**, building practical AI solutions that solve real-world business problems.

### 💡 My Philosophy

I believe technology's true power is unlocked when it directly drives business results. Whether it's optimizing a database to speed up a site or building an AI model to predict customer behavior, my focus is always on creating measurable value.
